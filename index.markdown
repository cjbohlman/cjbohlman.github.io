## Hello world, my name is **Christopher Bohlman**! 

I am currently working as a tech team member at **Fast Enterprises**.

I graduated from the **University of Arizona** with a BSc in **Computer Science**.

Even after college, I am still looking to learn more about programming!

I write [here](https://cjbohlman.hashnode.dev/) about whatever programming topics tickle my fancy.

Please look through my GitHub profile and my portfolio to check out what I've been working on.
